            The TL;DR Up-Front
        </h3>
    We are a group of six curious tinkerers spread across the globe, in a variety of levels of education and occupation, ranging from our early twenties to late forties.<br>
    We believe in the power of open source software and code. As a result, whenever possible we have open Github repositories and verified smart contract code available.<br><br>

    We'd love to have you along for the journey, but we are NOT a get-rich-quick scheme.<br>If that's what you're looking for, there are other projects and other smart contracts out there with an explicit focus on obtaining wealth for wealth's sake.<br>Not us - we're the kids that make cool projects for cool's sake. Keep an eye out for <a href="http://pyrebirds.com">PyreBirds</a>!<br><br>

    As a unified group, we are decided:<br>
    * We will never employ dubious practices such as referral links, bot-spam manipulation or intentional fear, uncertainty and doubt.<br>
    * We will never make patently false claims such as guaranteed ROI, or that this is a reasonable quasi-investment of any format.<br>
    * We will never exit-scam.<br>

    ^ Point of fact: all of our deployed contracts explicitly disallow exit-scamming, and you can check this in our code. They are all open-source and/or externally vetted.<br><br>

    For the full, more detailed version, keep reading.

            The EthPhoenix Philosophy
        </h3>
		<h2>So What Is This All About?</h2><br>
        <p>One question that gets asked of us quite a lot is "What is it you're actually trying to <i>achieve</i>? What's the end game?"<br><br>
           We'd like to use this page to set out a definitive statement of what the EthPhoenix (EPX) project is intended to be.<br><br>
           By this, we mean a set of concrete rules stating clearly what we <i>are</i> and what we <i>aren't</i>, and what we (as a team) would like to see.           
        </p>        
        
        <h3 class="ui header">Who We Are</h3><br>
        <p>One of the first things that might stand out to people who have stumbled on this page is a distinct lack of a "developers" page.<br><br>
            It's a fair criticism to say that that means we have something to hide. There is no response to this that doesn't sound like we're hand-waving, so we'll give it to you straight.<br><br>
            We're not (and likely never will be) certain that this mad rollercoaster is, in fact, legal. We truly hope that it is, but ignorantia juris non excusat.<br>
            Whilst crypto is as yet (and hopefully soon will be) regulated, we believe ourselves to be on the right side of history here, for reasons which we describe below.<br>
            However, our view is ultimately irrelevant in the eyes of various national and regional legislatures.<br><br>
            We hope that in time we will be able to identify ourselves, but for now, here's the Cliff Notes version:<br><br>
            
            * We are a group of six curious tinkerers spread across the globe, in a variety of levels of education and occupation, ranging from our early twenties to late forties.<br><br>
            * We're all fascinated by the cryptocurrency space, and get our joy from envisioning and implementing mad ideas (this page being one of them!).<br><br>
            * We've become a group of fast friends as a result of working together on this project, and yet, barring two, none of us have ever met in person.<br><br>
            * Because of the above point, we're probably going to have to draw straws for who buys the beers. We have a good idea who's going to lose.<br><br>
            * We believe in the power of open source software and code. As a result, whenever possible we have open Github repositories and verified smart contract code available.<br>   
        </p> 
        
		<h3 class="ui header">What We Aren't</h3><br>
        <p>It's a lot easier to sketch the outline of our goals by explicitly stating what we are <i>against</i>. So, don't expect any of the following from us:<br><br>
        
            * We are <b>not</b> a get-rich-quick scheme. There are other smart contracts out there with an explicit focus on obtaining wealth for wealth's sake.<br><br>
            * We are <b>not</b> doing this for our own financial benefit. For the most part, we live comfortably, and want to see this project succeed for it's own sake.<br><br>
            * We are <b>not</b> a group that will ever employ dubious practices such as referral links, bot-spam manipulation or intentional fear, uncertainty and doubt.<br><br>
            * We are <b>not</b> ever going to make any patently false claims such as guaranteed ROI, or that this is a reasonable quasi-investment of any format. It is<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;designed to feed off of the emotions of its participants at a primal level. We are working on ways to add value outside of the zero-sum nature<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the `game', but even then it is a mad gamble. Do not contribute <b>anything</b> you are not comfortable with losing in its entirety.<br><br>
            * We are <b>not</b> a group that would exit-scam with hundreds of Ether. Point of fact: we couldn't do it even if we <i>did</i> want to.
        </p>  
        
		<h3 class="ui header">What We Are</h3><br>
        <p>With our lines in the sand drawn, there are several more things that we aspire to be, both as a developer team and as EthPhoenix the platform:<br><br>
            
            * We <b>are</b> a team who want nothing more than to create games and applications on the blockchain that are innovative, engaging and rewarding.<br><br>
            * We <b>are</b> interested in new topics of research in the field. As an example, we recently launched Phoeni&chi;Coin (PHX) as a derivative cryptocurrency<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;based upon the underlying volatility of the EPX smart contract. The white paper for PHX can be found <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3140310">here</a>.<br><br>
            * We <b>are</b> a team willing to help out with issues that fellow developers approach us for advice with. We have already established a history of doing so.<br><br>
            * We <b>are</b> a friendly bunch who regularly hang around in the EPX Discord. We strive for visibility and availability during nearly every hour of the day.<br><br>
            * [Sidenote] We <b>are</b> the same team behind EthPyramid. In fact, the smart contract states as such.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This name -- intended to be ironic -- did not serve us well in being taken seriously as an aspiring ecosystem, hence the front-end refactor.
            
        </p>        
        
		<h3 class="ui header">Our Goals</h3><br>
        <p>Our goals were initially quite simple ones.<br><br>
        
        Whilst we initially set out as a group to repair a faulty smart-contract which led to the theft of millions of dollars worth of Ether, we soon realised just how<br>
        well we all worked together as a team. We pushed ideas out quickly and with solid craftsmanship, and after the release of PHX, decided that we wanted to build a whole range of
        decentralised applications making use of it.<br><br>
        
        As of the time this was written, we have five main goals:<br><br>
   
            * Pivot EPX from being seen as "just another pyramid-like smart contract" into a Kickstarter-like generator for creating PHX coins to be used in our applications.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is in this way that we hope to add value to what is -- and always was -- a zero-sum wealth distribution model.<br><br>
            * Release our flagship DApp -- PyreBirds -- combining elements from all of the games that we as developers loved from our pasts.<br><br>
            * See PHX receive a level of recognition as a viable gaming token to the point where it is mentioned in the same breath as cryptocurrencies such as FunFair.<br><br>
            * Push the limits of our creativity/group insanity to continue producing ever more novel products in the Ethereum blockchain.<br><br>
            * Keep a realistic view of our expansive potential. EPX could shoot up to having over a thousand Ether, or down to less than fifty. The balance doesn't matter to us as<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;developers, provided that each and every participant is aware of, <i>and accepts</i>, the financial risks that may arise as a result of participation.  
        </p>        
        
		<h3 class="ui header">Final Thoughts</h3><br>
        <p>It may be the case that people who read this page and are participants decide that as a result, this project is no longer for them.<br><br>
           To them we say, thank you from the bottom of our hearts for the support so far, be it either in our various chat forums, donations to the marketing address, or simply by making us laugh.
           Each and every one of you has been the reason why we've poured so much of our time into this despite maintaining full-time jobs.<br><br>
           You've brought the excitement of inventing for people's entertainment back to us, and that's a rare gift which we can never repay.<br><br>
           
           We wish all of you; those who remain, those who have left, and those who are undecided either way, our sincerest well-wishes for the future, whatever that may hold, whether or not we play a factor in that.
           You're truly the side of the Internet which we envisioned when we were younger and naive to the ways of the web.<br><br>
           
           Thank you.
        </p>
