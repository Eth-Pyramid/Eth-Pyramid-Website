        'faq.similar.q' => 'Q: Wasn\'t there something similar to this earlier?',
        'faq.similar.a' => 'A: Yes, there are several variations of ponzis, pyramids, and other schemes; EthPyramid is the next step forward with convertible dividends and 10% redistribution on sell.',
        'faq.security.q' => 'Q: Is EthPyramid secure?',
        'faq.security.a' => 'A: Yes. Our dev team put a lot of time into refining and testing this contract to make sure your tokens are safe. Internal functions of the contract are not accessible to the end user.',
        'faq.requirements.q' => 'Q: What do I need to buy into this Pyramid?',
        'faq.requirements.a' => 'A: You need to install <a href="https://metamask.io/">Metamask</a> and also need to buy some Ether (ETH), probably from something like Coinbase.',
        'faq.pre-mined.q' => 'Q: Is this coin pre-mined?',
        'faq.pre-mined.a' => 'A: No. Nor are there any loops in the code that allow us to take Ether out of the contract in any ways that you yourself are not capable of.',
        'faq.what-happens.q' => 'Q: So exactly what happens with the tokens that I buy?',
        'faq.what-happens.a' => 'A: Every time somebody buys or sell an EthPyramid token, the price changes - 0.2% higher upon buy, 0.2% lower upon sell. If you keep your tokens where they are, you receive 10% from every buy OR sell transaction based upon your current share of tokens. You can convert your current token stash into Ether where it will sit in your dividends pool - your dividends are stored in ETH, not in tokens, so their value remains stable (as long as the ETH price itself remains stable.) However once you\'ve converted your tokens, you won\'t be gaining any dividends - and if you want back in you\'ll need to either purchase more or simply convert your dividends pool straight back into tokens.',
        'faq.more-info.q' => 'Q: Hmm, sounds interesting. Can you tell me more?',
        'faq.more-info.a' => 'A: Our system mitigates the risk of fast dumping by penalizing sellers for doing so. If there is a sell off period, you will still be collecting dividends, as well as gain a larger portion of the total token market share in the process. If a buy/sell cycle occurs, the token holders will still collect dividends off the sales, in addition to gaining a larger portion of the total token market share in the process. This way, those who attempt to time the market and perform swing trades; selling high and re-buying low, will be risking a lot - and losing out on soaking up all those precious dividends. If you\'d prefer to sit back and play it safe you will profit off of the madness of the greedy whales and weak-handed alike.',
        'faq.play-safe.q' => 'Q: So I should definitely get into credit card debt to play this game?',
        'faq.play-safe.a' => 'A: NO. You most certainly should not be putting anything you can\'t afford to lose on this. PLEASE do not consider this to be anything other than what it intends to be: an insane proof of concept turned global prisoners dilemma. It is a joke, and should be treated as such. Do not put anything in here that you are not immediately willing to treat as lost.',
        'faq.guarantee.q' => 'Q: So what is that you guarantee exactly?',
        'faq.guarantee.a' => 'A: Nothing. Seriously. Pyramid schemes are, by definition, a zero sum game. The risk is entirely yours. Tread carefully. Good luck and have fun! And remember, it\'s internet monopoly money. Don\'t do anything you\'ll lose sleep (or your family) over.',
