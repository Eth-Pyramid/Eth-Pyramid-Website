		<?php __('A: Every time somebody buys or sell an EthPyramid token, the price changes - 0.2% higher upon buy, 0.2% lower upon sell. If you keep your tokens where they are, you receive 10% from every buy OR sell transaction based upon your current share of tokens. You can convert your current token stash into Ether where it will sit in your dividends pool - your dividends are stored in ETH, not in tokens, so their value remains stable (as long as the ETH price itself remains stable.) However once you\'ve converted your tokens, you won\'t be gaining any dividends - and if you want back in you\'ll need to either purchase more or simply convert your dividends pool straight back into tokens.'); ?>

		<?php __('A: Our system mitigates the risk of fast dumping by penalizing sellers for doing so. If there is a sell off period, you will still be collecting dividends, as well as gain a larger portion of the total token market share in the process. If a buy/sell cycle occurs, the token holders will still collect dividends off the sales, in addition to gaining a larger portion of the total token market share in the process. This way, those who attempt to time the market and perform swing trades; selling high and re-buying low, will be risking a lot - and losing out on soaking up all those precious dividends. If you\'d prefer to sit back and play it safe you will profit off of the madness of the greedy whales and weak-handed alike.'); ?>
